<h2>This Website</h2>
<p>After several days working together, we manage to get a very basic website up and running.</p>
<p>The website was done from scratch and with just 2$USD for the first year. The domain name was bought in GoDaddy.</p> 
<p>The site is hosted on a EC2 instance on Amazon Cloud. The backend is a <a href='https://expressjs.com/'>Node/Express</a> server, linked to a MongoDB database to store comments. The server uses <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs'>ejs</a> template engine to render HTML on the fly.</p>
<p>The frontend style is written in <a href='https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass'>Sass</a>. It is not using frameworks but Bootstrap or Tailwind and JQuery may be implemented.</p>
<p>The source code can be found at <a href="https://github.com/santimirandarp/">Github.</a></p>

<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>Linda is learning to produce music using Ableton, and brushing up statistics in SPSS. Santi is tinkering with raspberry pis.</p>
