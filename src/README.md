# TwoTravellers Blog

July 2th 2021

First the draft of the website, then the structure and functionality.

The web will be simple: home, reviews and pictures page.

The home page is very clean and simple, header, main, and footer.

The pictures page is a grid of preview images + a slug, and you can click each image, and be redirected to a more comprehensive page.

The reviews will be comments written by Hosts.
