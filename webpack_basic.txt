# What is Webpack

Webpack is used to compile JavaScript modules. Use it as CLI or Node API. (Loading webpack into a js file, or webpack-stream for gulp).

## How to Install and Run
npm install webpack [webpack-cli] [webpack-streams] --save-dev

## Import/Export
Webpack will resolve the import/export graph.

Note that webpack will not alter any code other than import and export statements. If you are using other ES2015 features, make sure to use a transpiler such as Babel via webpack's loader system.


## Loaders

Loaders are transformations that are applied to the source code of a module. They allow you to pre-process files as you import or “load” them. Thus, loaders are kind of like “tasks” in other build tools and provide a powerful way to handle front-end build steps.

module.rules allows you to specify several loaders within your webpack configuration. This is a concise way to display loaders, and helps to maintain clean code. It also offers you a full overview of each respective loader.

Loaders are evaluated/executed from right to left (or from bottom to top). 

```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  output: {
    filename: 'my-first-webpack.bundle.js',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [{ test: /\.txt$/, use: 'raw-loader' }],
  },
};
```

"Hey webpack compiler, when you come across a path that resolves to a '.txt' file inside of a require()/import statement, use the raw-loader to transform it before you add it to the bundle."

mode and target are also options from the main JSON that should be properly set ex `mode:"development"|"production", target:"web"|"node"`.

Loaders follow the standard module resolution. In most cases it will be loaded from the module path (think npm install, node_modules).

### Links

An important question is what happens when webpack compiles the JS, places it into a suitable location that is linked to the html, with all the rest of the links. Because now probably the directory structure has changed. For this, the css-loader replaces the background images witht he right link on css/sass, and the html loader does this for the html written images.
