<h2>This Website</h2>
<p>After several days working together, we manage to get a very basic website up and running.</p>
<p>These days having a website shows many relevant skills: writing, IT awareness, design and coding.
And more importantly, it's an efficient way to communicate with the world.</p>
<p>The website was done from scratch. It's hosted on a EC2 instance in Amazon Cloud. It runs a <a href='https://expressjs.com/'>Node/Express</a> server, that renders part of the pages on the fly, using <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs'>ejs</a>. The style on the other hand is written in <a href='https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass'>Sass</a>.</p>
<p>The source code for this site can be found on <a href="https://github.com/santimirandarp/">Github.</a></p>

<h2>Other Projects</h2>
<p>Linda is learning to produce music using Ableton, and brushing up statistics in SPSS. Santi is tinkering with raspberry pis.</p>
